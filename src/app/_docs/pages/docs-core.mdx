## Introduction

Simple-UI-Components is a **personal, local-first collection** of unique, editable UI components built entirely from my own ideas and inspirations — not a published, full-blown UI library.

This isn’t designed to provide every single component you’d expect in a standard library. Instead, it’s a **curated set of reusable and creative components** with distinctive UI, meant for developers who want to directly edit, adapt, and integrate components into their own projects.

### Key Principles

- **Not a full library — a personal collection:** made for portfolio work, prototypes, and internal tools; focused on uniqueness, not covering every use case.
- **Install only what you need:** there’s no single package install — each component can be added individually via the CLI. The entire site and components live in one repo.
- **Fully customizable, zero lock-in:** copy, tweak, and transform components however you like. Most support configurable props and CSS variables.
- **Every component is documented:** with examples, usage notes, and prop references.
- **Built with purpose:** reflects my design taste, creativity, and learning journey. You may find some styles don’t fit your taste — and that’s fine; they’re easy to modify.

**Note:** Every component UI is created from scratch based on my own ideas; nothing is copied from other libraries or sites.

## Usage

export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

See each component's page in **Components** for props, variants, and examples.

## Customization

- Tailwind-based, override via `className` or custom wrapper.
- Supports theme tokens (CSS variables) for light/dark.

Example:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600">Delete</Button>
```

## Functionality

- **Accessible** — ARIA patterns, keyboard support.
- **Responsive** — mobile-first, responsive variants.
- **Tree-shakable** — import only what you use.
- **Theme-ready** — light/dark support built-in.
