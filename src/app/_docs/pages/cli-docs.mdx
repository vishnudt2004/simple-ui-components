# Simple UI Components ‚Äì CLI Documentation

(**suic-cli**)

## Overview

`suic-cli` is a command-line tool to quickly add **Simple UI Components** to your project. It fetches components from the registry and installs them in your project folder.

**MVP Note:**

Currently, it only supports the `add` functionality. Future plans include `remove`, `update`, and more component management features.

## Installation

Install globally with `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`:

```bash
# npm
npm install -g suic-cli

# pnpm
pnpm install -g suic-cli

# yarn
yarn global add suic-cli
```

Or use `npx`, `pnpx dlx`, or `yarn dlx` without installing:

```bash
# npx
npx suic-cli add <component-name>

# pnpm
pnpm dlx suic-cli add <component-name>

# yarn
yarn dlx suic-cli add <component-name>
```

<Callout title="Tip">

It‚Äôs recommended to run the CLI without installing globally. You can use `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, or `yarn dlx` to always run the latest version temporarily.

```

<Callout title="Note">

- If **no components are specified**, you‚Äôll be prompted to select from the available components in the registry.
- Component names are **case-insensitive** (`button` and `Button` are equivalent).

</Callout>

## Behavior

- If a component exists in the registry:
  - It will be installed.
  - ‚úÖ Success message is logged.

- If a component fails to fetch:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning is logged.

- If a component is **not found in the registry**:
  - ‚ùå Error is logged.

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
‚àö Which components would you like to add? ¬ª Button, Card, Unknown
‚úÖ Successfully added components: Button, Card
‚ùå Components not found in registry: Unknown
üåê Visit the docs site for available components: https://suic-docs.vercel.app/docs/cli
```

---

## Configuration

- By default, `suic-cli` stores components in:

```plaintext
<project-root>/components/suic
```

- You can specify a custom directory with the `--cwd` or `-c` _\<path\>_ option:

**Example:**

```bash
suic-cli add Button -c path/to/project
```

- The CLI automatically creates a config file `suic.config.json` in your project root if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
- You can also create the config manually with the format:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/project",
  "componentsDir": "/absolute/path/to/project/components/suic"
}
```

## Tips

- If you don‚Äôt specify components, you will be prompted to select from the available registry.
- Always refer to the docs site for the **latest components**: [https://suic-docs.vercel.app/docs/cli](https://suic-docs.vercel.app/docs/cli)
